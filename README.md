# Minesweeper
Minesweeper is a logic puzzle video game genre generally played on personal computers. The game features a grid of clickable tiles, with hidden "menus" (depicted as naval mines in the original game) scattered throughout the board. The objective is to clear the board without detonating any means, with help from blues about the number of neighboring mines in each field. Variants of Minesweeper have been made that depend on the basic concepts, such as Minesweeper X, Cross mines, and Mine hunt. Minesweeper has been incorporated as a mini game in other games, such as RuneScape and Minecraft's 2015 April Fool's update.
